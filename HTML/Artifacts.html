				<h2>Antikythera Shipwreck</h2>
				<p>
					The Antikythera Shipwreck, discovered off the coast of Greece in 1900, is an ancient treasure trove that dates back to around 70-60 BCE. This shipwreck has provided a window into the trade and artistic sophistication of the Hellenistic period. It contained a variety of artifacts, including statues, luxury goods, and the famed Antikythera Mechanism. The diversity of these finds highlights the extensive trade networks of the ancient Mediterranean and offers valuable insights into the daily life, culture, and economy of the time.

						<p>
							The Antikythera Mechanism, found within the shipwreck, is considered one of the most remarkable technological achievements of antiquity. Often referred to as the worldâ€™s first analog computer, this intricate device was used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses. Made of bronze and featuring an intricate system of gears, it demonstrates the advanced understanding of mechanics and astronomy held by the ancient Greeks. Its discovery challenges the notion that such sophisticated technology was beyond the capabilities of this era.

				<h2>Ethical Issues in Archaeology</h2>
				<article>
					<h3>The Parthenon Marbles</h3>
					<p>
						The Parthenon Marbles, also known as the Elgin Marbles, are a collection of classical Greek sculptures originally part of the Parthenon and other structures on the Acropolis of Athens. These artifacts, dating back to the 5th century BCE, include friezes, metopes, and statues that showcase the artistic brilliance of ancient Greece, attributed to the sculptor Phidias and his workshop. The marbles were removed in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin and later sold to the British Museum, where they remain on display.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						The removal and possession of the Parthenon Marbles have sparked significant ethical debates. Greece argues that the marbles are an integral part of the Parthenon, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and should be returned to their original location to preserve their cultural and historical unity. Supporters of repatriation also highlight that modern Greece has established the Acropolis Museum, a world-class facility capable of housing and preserving the marbles in their proper context.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						On the other hand, the British Museum and its supporters claim that Lord Elgin legally acquired the marbles with permission from the Ottoman authorities who ruled Greece at the time. They also argue that the marbles have been preserved and made accessible to a global audience, promoting awareness of ancient Greek culture. This debate raises broader ethical questions about colonial-era acquisitions, cultural heritage ownership, and the responsibilities of museums in addressing historical injustices.
