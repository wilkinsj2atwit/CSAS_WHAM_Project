				<h3>The Parthenon Marbles</h3>
				<p>
					The Parthenon Marbles, removed by Lord Elgin in the early 19th century, 
					are currently housed in the British Museum. The Greek government has long 
					requested their return, citing cultural heritage and ownership rights. The 
					British Museum argues their preservation and accessibility are best served 
					in London.
